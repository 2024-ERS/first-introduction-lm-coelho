## Working in Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
Some labels are use as code information, not necessarily in the document. For this use function **output: false**.
Always call for the **library()** from where you need your functions.

```{r}
#| label: load-libraries
#| output: false
library(tidyverse) # load the tidyverse libraries, including readr
```

## Data source

### Enter data in script 

Data can be entered by typing them into your script
```{r}
#| label: enter-data-in-script
#| warning: false
 
x<-c(1,2,3,4)
y<-c(1,4,3,5)
data1<-data.frame(x,y)
print(data1)

```

Data can be collected from a file in your computer, **setwd**, or from a online source. Once sources are from a online shared document, it's necessary to use a function that reads csv ("links"), **read_csv()**.

```{r}
#| label: read-google-sheets-data
#| output: false

test_link<- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gYg3Skw8oWJHTh9pwEXbUP_tddFZNxu3l8ZE7TkMCCo/pub?gid=1669069809&single=true&output=csv"
VegCoverage<-read_csv(test_link)
VegCoverage
print(VegCoverage)
view(VegCoverage)

```


Once you have your data you can analyse it using the different columns, for example to perform different plots and check for correlation.
You can use **#/ fig-cap:** show description of plots.

```{r}
#| label: fig-boxplot
#| fig-cap: Boxplot of the vegetation converage observed for each species. 

ggplot(data=VegCoverage, 
       mapping=aes(x=Species_ID,y=CoverPerc)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
